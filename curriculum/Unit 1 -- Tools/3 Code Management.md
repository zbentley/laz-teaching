## Code Management

#### Organization
- Take the program from the final of the workflow technologies unit, and give it two entry points: one for the console, and one for the web. The code to actually print out the "hostname :: time :: static string" should only be written in one place.
	- If this is Java, you can have two `.class`/`.jar` files for each entry point, if you like.

#### Packaging
- Given your Java program from the workflow technologies unit's source code *and nothing else*, write a *single terminal command* that causes the program to display its output. Explain how the command works.
	- XC: reduce your command to one word, with no other symbols, e.g. `./my_java_program`. Hint: you can change your source code if you like, and at the end of this step your program may not be all in one language.

#### Version Control
- Last: github.
