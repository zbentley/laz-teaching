## Code Management

#### Organization
- Take the program from the final of the "Development Tools" unit, and give it two entry points: one for the console, and one for the web. The code to actually print out the "hostname :: time :: static string" should only be written in one place.
	- If this is Java, you can have two `.class`/`.jar` files for each entry point, if you like.

#### Packaging
- Given your Java program from the "Development Tools" unit's source code *and nothing else*, write a *single terminal command* that causes the program to display its output. Explain how the command works.
- Compile your Java program into a JAR file such that you can run it by doing `java my_program.jar` on the terminal.
	- XC: reduce the command needed to run your program to *one word*, with no spaces, e.g. `./my_java_program`. Hint: you can change your source code if you like, and at the end of this step your program may not be all in one language. Note: this is perhaps the most difficult extra-credit problem.

#### Version Control
- Last: github.
