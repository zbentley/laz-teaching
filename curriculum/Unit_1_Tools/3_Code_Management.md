<ul>
<li>Take the program from the final of the “Development Tools” unit, and give it two entry points: one for the console, and one for the web. The code to actually print out the “hostname :: time :: static string” should only be written in one place.
<ul>
<li>If this is Java, you can have two <code>.class</code>/<code>.jar</code> files for each entry point, if you like.</li>

<ul>
<li>Given your Java program from the “Development Tools” unit’s source code <em>and nothing else</em>, write a <em>single terminal command</em> that causes the program to display its output. Explain how the command works.</li>
<li>Compile your Java program into a JAR file such that you can run it by doing <code>java my_program.jar</code> on the terminal.
<ul>
<li>XC: reduce the command needed to run your program to <em>one word</em>, with no spaces, e.g. <code>./my_java_program</code>. Hint: you can change your source code if you like, and at the end of this step your program may not be all in one language. Note: this is perhaps the most difficult extra-credit problem.</li>
