<h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3>
<p>Demonstrate that you have completed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make two VMs from scratch. Give me their IPs and MAC addresses on your LAN.</li>
<li>Write a program, in any language, that prints out the hostname of whatever machine it is running on, and then the static string <code>Hi, Laz!</code>.</li>
<li>Using your IDE, and without manually copying or moving any files, install that program on one of your two VMs. All development must also be done in this Git repository.</li>
<li>SSH to that VM without a password, and run the program.</li>
<li>Using Git and SSH (without your IDE), install the program on the <em>other</em> VM, and run it.</li>
<li>Update the program to also print out the first ten lines of <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> after it prints out the hostname of the machine on which it is running and <code>Hi, Laz!</code>.</li>
<li>Run the program again on the first and second VM with the updated code. At no point should you have to manually copy or move files.</li>
</ul>

<p>This part will be interactive. I’ll play the “dumb user”, and ask you for the program you wrote in the previous suggestion, and will break various things about my environment/universe so that it can’t run. I’ll ask you to teach me/walk me through the solutions to each of these problems as I encounter them. Some of them will be problems you’ve solved already; some will not.</p>
