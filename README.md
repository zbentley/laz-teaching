Materials used in software engineering excercises with Laz.

### Organization
- The `materials` directory contains miscellaneous materials related to the coursework. Assignment results/solutions should _not_ be submitted to this directory.
- The `curriculum` directory contains assignment files and work-in-progress ongoing changes to the studies. Assignment results/solutions should _not_ be submitted to this directory.
- The `assignments` directory contains user-uploaded results of various assignments. Each of these results should satisfy one or more parts of the curriculum.
	- Uploading unfinished assignments here is OK, so long as they're work towards one of the curriculum bullets. Notes that are used for more than one part of the study or other materials should go in `misc`.
- The `misc` directory contains notes and any other user-uploaded materials not needed for any one specific curriculum bullet.
