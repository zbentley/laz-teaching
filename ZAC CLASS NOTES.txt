RUNNING A PYTHON SCRIPT

hello.py needs "#!/usr/bin/env python" at the beginning
THEN
chmod +x hello.py
export PATH=$PATH:/home/Desktop/Zac_Class
hello.py OR ./hello.py
DIFFERENT PATH IS JUST

dir1/dir2/dir3/hello.py ("./" just means everything in current directory)

To call from anywhere: export PATH=$PATH:/root/Desktop/Zac_Class -> hello.py
 -> make change permanent by adding above line to /etc/bash.bashrc file

Hypervisor - sometimes called a Virtual Machine Monitor, is a piece of software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. There are two types: native (or "bare metal", runs on the hardware), and "hosted", which run on a conventional OS like other programs, like VMWare. "Host" is primary computer while "guest" would be the virtual machine.
